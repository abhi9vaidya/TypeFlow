# Contributing to TypeFlow

First off, thank you for considering contributing to TypeFlow! It's people like you that make it such a great tool for the community.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the GitHub issue tracker.
- Check if the bug has already been reported.
- Provide a clear, descriptive title and as much information as possible (steps to reproduce, expected behavior, screenshots).

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open a "Feature Request" on the issue tracker.
- Explain the benefit of the feature and how it should work.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
5. Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).

## Style Guide

- Write descriptive commit messages.

## Development Setup
